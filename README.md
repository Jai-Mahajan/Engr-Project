Utilizing a cell phone or driving while intoxicated when driving is a dangerous habit that causes drivers all over the world
to lose concentration on the road directly in front of them. Since the 2000s, distracted driving has killed innocent people
and contributed to around 25% of collisions annually, which is a considerably big portion of yearly crashes. Although most
people know how dangerous and prevalent this issue has become, nothing has been done to decrease the rate of
distracted driving. Due to the severity of this problem, it must be addressed and prevented.

Therefore, we created a product that ensures that people do not take their hands off of the steering wheel, or else an alarm 
will sound to remind the driver to put their hands back on the wheel. This project contained many steps such as brainstorming,
research, prototyping, experimenting, and testing.
